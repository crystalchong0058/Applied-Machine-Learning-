# Decoding Financial Sentiments: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Approaches

## Abstract

This project analyzes machine learning techniques for financial sentiment analysis, addressing challenges like domain-specific terminology and class imbalance. Key insights include:
1. Simpler bag-of-words models often suffice for financial texts.
2. Deep learning models outperform traditional methods with rich feature representations.
3. Addressing class imbalance significantly improves model performance.
4. FinBERT excels in capturing nuances of financial sentiment compared to generic models.

## Features

- **Dataset**: Expert-labeled financial news dataset (5,842 sentences) with positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- **Models**:
  - Traditional: Softmax Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes.
  - Deep Learning: CNN, FinBERT.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Macro-Averaged F1-Score.

## Setup

### Environment
- **Platform**: Google Colab.
- **Languages**: Python 3.10.12.
- **Key Libraries**: 
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow.
  - NLP: Gensim, Hugging Face Transformers.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd financial-sentiment-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbhatti/financial-sentiment-analysis/data).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Case normalization, lemmatization, and removal of punctuation, stop words, and special characters.
   - Addressed class imbalance using `RandomOverSampler`.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Bag of Words, N-Gram, TF-IDF, Word2Vec.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Fine-tuned models to optimize hyperparameters.
   - Evaluated using a test set with metrics like macro F1-Score.

4. **Deep Learning**:
   - CNNs with Word2Vec embeddings.
   - FinBERT for domain-specific sentiment analysis.

## Results

| Model              | Accuracy | Macro F1-Score |
|--------------------|----------|----------------|
| Softmax Regression | 0.541    | 0.234          |
| Naive Bayes        | 0.544    | 0.242          |
| CNN                | 0.595    | 0.503          |
| FinBERT            | 0.654    | 0.559          |

## Key Takeaways

- Financial sentiment analysis benefits from domain-specific pre-trained models like FinBERT.
- Simpler methods like bag-of-words often perform well for financial texts, though deep learning provides significant gains.
